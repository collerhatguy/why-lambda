        One of my main reasons for wanting to push 
        through lambda academy is monetary profit.
        Ever since I was young I had a propensity 
        to collect small change in jars and count 
        my savings on a regular basis. Now that 
        I’m an adult living on my own dollar my 
        obsession with money is even stronger. 
        I hate worrying about whether I can 
        afford rent for x time and want to get to 
        the point where I don't ever think about money. 
        I would also like to be able to have kids down 
        the line at some point and so money is 
        necessary for that too.

        Another reason for going to lambda is that I genuinely 
        like coding. It's very satisfying to have a brain child 
        come into your head and putting forth the effort to bring 
        it into reality. I had been trying to learn web development 
        for about a year and didn’t get any job offers, but I don't 
        regret any of it because I built so much and learned so much.

        Making friends is another motivation for attending. It's very 
        rare for me to meet someone who understands and is interested 
        in what I'm working on. So, I'm excited at the idea of being 
        able to meet like minded people and see what they produce and 
        vice versa. There were alot of points where I was really stuck 
        on a project and thought it would be the best thing if I could 
        have a second pair of eyes looking at my screen. It will also 
        be satisfying to help other people with problems that I faced 
        when I first started out.

        Finally going to lambda is an opportunity for me to become more 
        disciplined. For a good portion of my life I have struggled to 
        stay focused on any one thing and commit to certain goals. Doing 
        something difficult and rewarding like lambda is an opportunity 
        to become sharper and more focused as a person as well as 
        becoming more skilled. I want to develop my character along with 
        my skills.
